# Clash-of-Clans-Discord-Bot
This Bot displays a users Clash of Clans stats with some basic commands.


This is different to the popular ClashofStats bot as it allows the user to set their player tag and clan tag. In the ClashofStats discord bot, one annoying problem is always having to type out your player tag (which is random characters and numbers) to view your stats. This program stores the discord user's player tag and clan tag using mongoDB that way the user can just type out the command and get stats from the Clash of Clans API. The user can set their player tag and clan tag once and never have to worry about it again!
